    1. Overview
            Creating scene tree by typing them to the source code is a bad
        idea. To make the developer more convenient, we decided to create a
        scene editor, and scene file format.
            Scene file formats have the extension: ssf (SPUKMK2me Scene File).
            Multi-byte data will be stored as they appear on the memory of
        big-endian machines.
        
            Scene file stores:
                - Information of all resources used: a file name (if the
                resource is loaded from file), an unique proxy name (for
                convenient access) and optional information which are based on
                specific type of resource.
                - Currently there are three kinds of resources is stored:
                    + IImageResource.
                    + ISubImage.
                    + BitmapFont.
                - Data to re-construct the scene tree. Some of important scene
                node has unique proxy name (not neccessary unique to the
                resources) so they can be accessed easily.
