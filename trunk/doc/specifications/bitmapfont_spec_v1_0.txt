 
    BitmapFont file format version 1.0 specification
    
    This file is provided along with SPUKMK2me library since version 0.1 as
a resource for user to create their own font data. This document may contain
some ambiguos data, please send email to us if you find any.
 
    This file contains the format of data file used by BitmapFont class
(provided in the package com.spukmk2me.optional.font). The version for this
format is 1.0.
 
    From now on, files that follow the specification described in this document
are called BitmapFont files.

    1. Overview
        This document describes the 2nd version of BitmapFont file format. The
        changes from last version (0.1) are:
            - Bit depth can be extended to 1, 2, 4 or 8.
            - Data for extra characters is reduced to 2 bytes per characters.
            - Reserved data size is increased to 128.

        Data of BitmapFont file can be divided into two main part:
            - Header.
            - Trunk.

        There is no gap between two part, that means the first byte of "Trunk"
        must be the byte stored right after the last byte of "Header" in
        BitmapFont file.
        
    2. Specification
        2.1 Header specification:
            Offset      Size        Data
            0x0000      2           Zero if the file is stored as big-endian
                                    style.
                                    Non zero if the file is stored as
                                    little-endian style.
                                    From now on, the data is assumed that
                                    they are read from a big-endian BitmapFont
                                    file.
            
            0x0002      24          "SPUKMK2me_BITMAPFONT_1.0"

            0x001A      2           The number of character provided by this
                                    font, must be at least 94 (94 ANSI
                                    characters, see "3. Other requirements" for
                                    more information). The number is an
                                    unsigned number.

            0x001C      2           Bit depth. Only supports 1, 2, 4 and 8.

            0x001E      2           The width of each character, unsigned.

            0x0020      2           The height of each character, unsigned.

            0x0022      2           The distance between two continuous
                                    characters, in pixels, unsigned.

            0x0024      2           The number of pixels that a "space" (0x20)
                                    takes, unsigned.
                                    
            0x0026      2           The y coordinate to put the underline, in
                                    pixels, unsigned.
                                    
            0x0028      2           The number of extra pixels that each italic
                                    character requires.
                                    
            0x002A      128         Reserved, should be filled by zero.
            
            0x00AA      (NCHAR -    The first 94 characters of BitmapFont are
                         94) * 2    fixed as 94 ANSI characters (see
                                    "3. Other requirements"). From 95th
                                    character, the characters are considered
                                    "extra" and the file must point out what
                                    characters they are via Unicode code.
                                    Each four continuous bytes form up a
                                    Unicode code. For example, 0x00A0 to 0x00A1
                                    is the Unicode code of the 95th character,
                                    0x00A2 to 0x00A3 is the Unicode code of the
                                    96th character.

        2.2 Trunk specification:
            Trunk part is written right after the header part, so the first
        byte of trunk part is located in the file offset
        0x00AA + (NCHAR - 94) * 2. Trunk part contains pixel data for the font
        which is described as follow:

                - Data of the first character must be written at the trunk
                offset 0.

                - Each character requires P bytes as the pixel data. And the
                data of characters are tightly packed, which means after P
                bytes of ith character must be P bytes of (i + 1)th character.
                
                - All data of NCHAR characters must be written.

                - The data of each character is described as follow:
                    + Each character are considered as an image. If the width W
                    of that image isn't divisible by 8, the width are extended
                    to the nearest divisible-by-8 number which is greater than
                    W.
                    + Each 8 continuous pixels are converted to 8 * bit depth
                    bits, respectively. If the pixel is onvisible it will be
                    converted to 0, otherwise it will be converted to a
                    non-zero value.
                    + Combine the converted data from the rows of image
                    respectively, we have the bitmap data for each character.
                    + Call the number of bytes in a row is B, and the height of
                    image is H, we have P = B * H bytes as bitmap data.
                    
    3. Other requirements:
        
        - Fixed characters:
            The BitmapFont file must store fixed 94 characters in the ASCII map
            at the beginning. Those 94 characters are counted from 0x31
            ('!' character) to 0x7E ('~' character). Since 0x20 (space) and
            0x7F (DEL) don't have visible glyphs, they are not included.
